## Jiro

Is a e-commerce framework based on Laravel although built from framwork-agnostic PHP packages. Our paradigm is based around the principal that e-commerce requirements are very unique to each case and a modular approach give syou leverage in this space.

## Contributing

Very early stages of development, we are looking for significant community participation, e-commerce is currently a large void in the PHP ecosphere. This project envisions filling that gap, lend us a hand and become part of something big while we are at ground zero. Please contact <andrewmclagan@gmail.com> if you would like to become a **core** contributer. 

Currently all development is being done on `jiro-commerce/jiro` and packages will be in `./jiro/package-name` folders through to `0.2.0` as its easier. There after we will split out all packages into their own repositories.

We are following the **PSR-2** coding style guide strictly.
