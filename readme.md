## Jiro [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/Jiro-Commerce/Jiro?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=body_badge)

Is an e-commerce framework based on Laravel and built from framwork-agnostic PHP packages. Our paradigm is based around the principal that e-commerce requirements are very unique to each use-case and a modular approach gives developers the leverage they need to address their applications requirements. 

## Contributing

Very early stages of development, we are looking for significant community participation. We believe the current PHP e-commerce offerings are lacking and present a void in the PHP ecosphere. This project envisions filling that gap, lend us a hand and become part of something big while we are at ground zero. Please contact <andrewmclagan@gmail.com> if you would like to become a **core** contributer. Otherwise submit pull-requests to the master branch.

Currently all development is being done on `jiro-commerce/jiro` and packages will be in `./jiro/package-name` folders through to `0.2.0` as its easier. There after we will split out all packages into their own repositories.

We are following the **PSR-2** coding style guide strictly.

Browse the issues and comment on anything you intend to work on so there is no crossover. We will setup a gitter channell ASAP.
